## 🌑 What is NoirScroll?

*NoirScroll* is a high-performance, distraction-free manga and webtoon reader built around a single philosophy: *the art comes first*. No cluttered sidebars. No intrusive ads. No accounts required. Just you and the story.

It aggregates content from multiple providers for maximum availability, syncs rich metadata from AniList, and stores everything — your history, bookmarks, tags, and reading stats — locally on your device. Your data never leaves your hands.

---
